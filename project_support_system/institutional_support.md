With this basis facility, DIC’s in the district level undertakes various promotional measures with a view to bringing out all development of SME in the district.

In starts from exploration of potential entrepreneurs to marketing the products produced by the SMEs. The DICs provide and arrange a package of assistance and facilities for credit guidance, raw materials, training, marketing etc. including the necessary help to unem­ployed educated young entrepreneurs in general.

Thus it may be said that DIC extends promotional, technical, physical, financial, marketing and all other type of services, required for growth and development of SSI.

The important functions of DICS are discussed as follow:

(i) Identification of Entrepreneurs:

DIC’s develop new entrepreneurs by conducting entrepreneurial motivation programmes throughout the district particularly under SEEUY scheme. DICs also take association of SIS’s and TCOs for conducting EDPs.

(ii) Provisional Registration:

Entrepreneurs can get provisional registration with DICs which enable them to take all necessary steps to bring the unit into existence. The entrepreneur can get assistance from term lending institutions only after getting provisional registration.

(iii) Permanent Registration:

When the entrepreneur completes all formalities required to commence the production like selection of site, power connection, installing machinery etc. they can apply to DIC for permanent registration. It is only after getting the permanent registration that the entrepreneur can apply for supply of raw mate­rials on concessional rates. Permanent registration is essential to avail all types of benefits extended by the government from time to time.

(iv) Purchases of Fixed Assets:

The DIC’s recommend loan applications of the prospective entrepreneur to various concerned financial and developmental institutions e.g. NSIC, SISI etc. for the purchase of fixed assets. It also recommend to the commercial banks for meeting the working capital requirement of SSI to run day-to-day operations.

(v) Clearances from Various Departments:

DIC takes the initiative to get clearances from various departments which is essential to start a unit. It even takes follow up measures to get speedy power connection.

(vi) Assistance to Village Artisans and Handicrafts:

In spite of inherent talent and ability, village artisans are not better off because they lack financial strength to strive in the competitive market. DIC in support with different lead banks and nationalized banks extends financial support to those artisans.

(vii) Incentives and Subsidies:

DIC helps SMEs and rural artisans to subsidies granted by government under various schemes. The different types of subsidies are power subsidy, interest subsidy for engineers and subsidy under IRDP etc. from various institutions.

(viii) Interest Free Sales Tax Loan:

SIDCO provides interest free sales tax loan up to a maximum limit of 8per cent of the total fixed assets for SSI units set up in rural areas. But the sanction order for the same is to be issued by DIC. The DIC recommends the case of SME to National Small Industries Corporation Limited for registration for Government purchase programme.

(ix) Assistance of Import and Export:

Government is providing various types of incentives for import and export of specific goods and services. These benefits can be availed by any importer or exporter provided the same is routed through the concerned DIC. Export and import license is also issued to the importer or exporter only on the basis of recommendation of DIC.

(x) Fairs and Exhibitions:

The DIC inspires and facilitates the SSI units to participate in various fairs and exhibitions which are organized by the Government of India and other organizations to give publicity to industrial products. DICs provide free space to SMEs for the display of their products and provide financial assistance for the purpose.

(xi) Training Programmes:

DIC organizes training programs to rural entrepreneurs and also assists other institutions or organization imparting training to train the small entrepreneurs.

(xii) Self-Employment for Unemployed Educated Youth:

The DICs have launched a scheme to assist the educated unemployed youth by providing them facilities for self-employment. The youth should be in the age group of 18 to 35 years with minimum qualification of Metric or Middle with I.T.I. in engineering or Technical Trade. Technocrats and women are given preference.

Thus the above mentioned organisations in all the categories have been set up and are steadily working towards the development of small indus­tries. The entrepreneurs would indeed be benefited, provided they take benefit from the services provided by these organisations. The assistance provided ranges from setting up of the business unit, financing, training, procuring of raw materials, purchase of plant and machinery, marketing of their products, selling, and exporting their products.

It is seen that the Government of India and the Government of Karnataka are indeed setting up these agencies to help the entrepreneurs, to motivate them in setting up more units which will not only help them but also help the economy.

They want to create more of job providers than job seekers. The entre­preneurs should make use of the facilities provided by the Governmental organisations and agencies in order to grow economically and become more competitive globally.
