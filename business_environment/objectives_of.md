# Objectives of

# Consumer Protection Act

The main objective of the Consumer Protection Act is to grant shield for the improved safeguard of consumers and their rights. Even though there is a prevailing Consumer Protection Act, it is still doubtful as to how far the objectives of the [Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Protection_Act,_1986. are  achieved.

Still we see that Rights of consumers are ignored but we hope the government will surely take necessary actions in order to establish the proclaimed fundamental rights soon. Government must ensure consumers right to be conversant regarding the purity, standard ,quality, quantity, potency, and value of goods, or services so as to shield the buyer against unfair trade practices.

**Problems of**  **Consumer Protection Act**  **1986:**

The following are a few  examples  as to  how  companies  are  involved  in  unfair  trade practices  in  order  to  attract  consumers. Few emerging issues related to the _Consumer Protection Act 1986_ are:

1. Unfair trade Practices: There are many unfair trade practices among the companies, if those practices cannot be stopped, the objectives of the _Consumer Protection Act_ 1986 will be difficult to achieve.

2. Spurious or Duplicate Goods: Numbers of fake companies very often imitate the design, color and shape and outlook of the original brand which is opposed to consumer rights. For example Fair & Lovely is imitated as Fairy & Lovely, Life Buoy as Life Boy etc.

3. Misleading  TV commercials are misleading; as because real promise of product is miles away from TV ads.

4. Gimmick of Warranty and Guaranty: There is no true warranty or guarantee at all. Many consumers do not know the legal essence of these two terms.

5. Pricing: Pricing is out of control and reach of the consumers. Most  of  the  consumers are  not  aware  about  the  essence  of  star  (\*)  which  means &quot;Conditions Apply&quot;. This means that the quoted price is applicable only upon happening of an event.

The other challenges consumer protection act 1986 are:

6. Recycled or Renovated Goods

7. Bogus Telemarketing

8. Unsecured Internet-Banking, etc.
