The nature of dividends is discussed below:

## Cash or Non-cash

Dividends may either be in cash or non-cash. Dividends are generally paid in cash to the shareholders but sometimes instead of cash payments, shares are issued to the existing shareholders, free of cash—which is known as issue of bonus shares.

## Final or Interim
After finalization of accounts, the directors judge the financial position and then recommend the amount of dividend at the annual general meeting. Such dividend is called final div­idend whereas any dividend paid between two annual general meetings is called interim dividend.

## Fixed or Variable

In case of profit, preference shareholders are entitled to get dividend at a fixed rate as per terms of their issue. Equity shareholders are entitled to get dividend out of the balance left after payment of preference dividend and their rate of dividend may vary from year to year depending on the volume of profit.
