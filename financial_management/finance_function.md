# Definition of the Finance Function

There are three ways of defining the finance function. Firstly, the finance function can simply be taken as the task of providing funds needed by an enterprise on favourable terms, keeping in view the objectives of the firm.

This means that the finance function is solely concerned with the acquisition (or procurement) of short- term and long-term funds.

However, in recent years, the coverage of the term ‘finance function’ has been widened to include the instruments, institutions and practices through which funds are obtained. So, the finance function covers the legal and accounting relationship between a company and its source and uses of funds.

For example, in financial management, we discuss debt-equity ratio (determined by the government), as also various accounting and legal aspects of dividend policy.

No doubt, the basic function of the finance manager is one of determining how funds can best be raised (i.e., at the minimum possible cost). In other words, the essence of finance function is keeping the business supplied with enough funds to fulfil its objectives.

But such a definition is too narrow and is not of much practical use. No doubt, the finance function is much broader than mere procurement of short-term and long-term funds so that a firm’s working capital and fixed capital needs can be met.

Another extreme view is that finance is concerned with cash. This definition is much too broad and thus is not really meaningful.

The third view — based on a compromise between the two — is more useful for practical purposes. This definition treats the finance function as the procurement of funds and their effective utilisation in business. The finance manager takes all decisions that relate to funds which can be obtained as also the best way of financing an investment such as the installation of a new machinery inside the factory-or office building.

The cost of the machinery may be financed by making a public issue of 8% cumulative preference shares. At the same time, he has to consider whether the additional return (cash flow) expected from the new machinery is sufficient to cover the cost of capital in terms of interest to be paid over a period of time.

In this case, the finance decision is based on an analysis of the alternative sources and uses of funds. To start with the finance manager has to draw a plan outlining the company’s need for funds. Such financial plan is based on forecasts of financial needs of the company. Such forecasts are based on sales forecasts.

In the next step, the finance manager has to raise necessary funds to meet the company’s need for fixed and working capital. Then, in the third step, he has to put the acquired funds into effective uses.

The sequence of the three-step process is presented below:

1. Drawing a financial plan and forecasting financial needs

2. Raising necessary funds

3. Putting funds into proper use.

In a broad sense, the finance function covers the following six major activities:

1. Financial planning

2. Forecasting cash inflows and outflows

3. Raising funds

4. Allocation of funds

5. Effective use of funds

6. Financial control (budgetary and non-budgetary)

The last function is very important. Through financial control the finance man­ager tries to bring performance closer to the targets.

# Scope of Finance Function

No doubt, the scope of finance function is wide because this function affects almost all the aspects of a firm’s operations. The finance function includes judgments about whether a company should make more investment in fixed assets or not.

It is largely concerned with the allocation of a firm’s capital expenditure over time as also related decisions such as financing investment and dividend distribution. Most of these decisions taken by the finance department affect the size and timing of future cash flow or flow of funds.

# Classification of Finance Function

Finance function can be classified into two broad categories, viz.,

1. [Executive finance function](#executive-functions)

2. [Incidental finance function](#incidental-function)

While the former requires administra­tion skill in planning and execution, the latter largely covers works of a routine nature, which are necessary to implement financial decisions at the executive level.

## Executive Functions

Six basic executive finance functions are the following:

1. ### Determining asset-management policies

    All finance functions are concerned with the control of both cash flows and non-cash assets. The reason is easy to find out. The finance managers must know how much cash will be ‘tied up’ in various kinds of non-cash (or non-liquid) assets.

    Without the information, it is not possible to estimate and arrange for necessary cash requirements. In fact, the formulation of sound and consistent asset management policies is an indispensable pre-requisite to successful financial management.

2. ### Determining the allocation of net profits

    This relates to retained earnings (corporate savings) and dividend policy. Most companies have to achieve balance between two alternatives, i.e., payment of dividends and the retention of earnings for acquiring additional assets.

3. ### Estimating cash flow requirements and control of such flows

    An important responsibility of the finance manager is to ensure an adequate flow of cash as and when it is needed. Otherwise, the smooth operation of a company may not be possible. Since cash flow originates from sales and cash requirements are closely related to sales volume, adequate cash can be provided at the proper time only after forecasting cash needs.

4. ### Taking decision on needs and sources of new external finance

    On the basis of sales forecasts, the financial managers will have to draw a plan to borrow funds from external sources. Such debt capital will add to the firm’s own cash resources and thus improve its financial position. External capital may be obtained by borrowing funds from commercial banks.

    The finance manager must be competent enough to determine exactly when additional funds from external sources will be needed. He (she) has also to judge how long they will be needed, how economically they can be raised (i.e., at the lowest possible cost) and from which sources will they be repaid.

5. ### Carrying on negotiations with outside financiers

    The finance manager has also to carry on negotiations with outsiders to be able to arrange for necessary external financing in required amount and on time. For obtaining working capital, a line of credit has to be established with commercial banks. Again sufficient time has to be devoted for completing arrangements for long-term financing. Long-term financing requires more skillful negotiations than short-term financing.

6. ### Checking upon financial performance:

    It is also necessary for the finance manager to evaluate the wisdom and efficiency of financial planning. Such evaluation is to be based on past performance of the company. This will enable the finance manager to improve the standards, tech­niques and procedures of financial planning and control which are important aspects of the finance function.

It may be noted that all the six functions are interrelated. This means that a change in decision with respect to any one of the functions will call for a change in decision relating to some or all other functions.

## Incidental Function

The incidental finance functions include supervision of cash inflows and outflows and maintaining cash balances and record keeping.
