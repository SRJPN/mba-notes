## PERT and CPM ##

PERT and CPM are techniques of project management useful in the basic managerial functions of planning, scheduling and control. PERT stands for “Programme Evaluation & Review Technique” and CPM are the abbreviation for “Critical Path Method”. These days the projects undertaken by business houses are very large and take a number of years before commercial production can start.

# Definition of PERT

PERT is an acronym for Program (Project) Evaluation and Review Technique, in which planning, scheduling, organizing, coordinating and controlling uncertain activities take place. The technique studies and represents the tasks undertaken to complete a project, to identify the least time for completing a task and the minimum time required to complete the whole project. It was developed in the late 1950s. It is aimed to reduce the time and cost of the project.

PERT uses time as a variable which represents the planned resource application along with performance specification. In this technique, first of all, the project is divided into activities and events. After that proper sequence is ascertained, and a network is constructed. After that time needed in each activity is calculated and the critical path (longest path connecting all the events) is determined.

# Definition of CPM

Developed in the late 1950s, Critical Path Method or CPM is an algorithm used for planning, scheduling, coordination and control of activities in a project. Here, it is assumed that the activity duration is fixed and certain. CPM is used to compute the earliest and latest possible start time for each activity.

The process differentiates the critical and non-critical activities to reduce the time and avoid the queue generation in the process. The reason for the identification of critical activities is that, if any activity is delayed, it will cause the whole process to suffer. That is why it is named as Critical Path Method.

In this method, first of all, a list is prepared consisting of all the activities needed to complete a project, followed by the computation of time required to complete each activity. After that, the dependency between the activities is determined. Here, ‘path’ is defined as a sequence of activities in a network. The critical path is the path with the highest length.

# Key Differences Between PERT and CPM

The most important differences between PERT and CPM are provided below:

1. PERT is a project management technique, whereby planning, scheduling, organising, coordinating and controlling uncertain activities are done. CPM is a statistical technique of project management in which planning, scheduling, organising, coordination and control of well-defined activities take place.

2. PERT is a technique of planning and control of time. Unlike CPM, which is a method to control costs and time.

3. While PERT is evolved as a research and development project, CPM evolved as a construction project.

4. PERT is set according to events while CPM is aligned towards activities.

5. A deterministic model is used in CPM. Conversely, PERT uses a probabilistic model.

6. There are three times estimates in PERT, i.e. optimistic time (to), most likely time ™, pessimistic time (tp). On the other hand, there is only one estimate in CPM.

7. PERT technique is best suited for a high precision time estimate, whereas CPM is appropriate for a reasonable time estimate.

8. PERT deals with unpredictable activities, but CPM deals with predictable activities.

 
9. PERT is used where the nature of the job is non-repetitive. In contrast to, CPM involves the job of repetitive nature.

10. There is a demarcation between critical and non-critical activities in CPM, which is not in the case of PERT.

11. PERT is best for research and development projects, but CPM is for non-research projects like construction projects.

12. Crashing is a compression technique applied to CPM, to shorten the project duration, along with the least additional cost. The crashing concept is not applicable to PERT.

# Steps required for using CPM and PERT

The following steps are required for using CPM and PERT for planning and scheduling:

1. Each project consists of several independent jobs or activities. All these jobs or activities must be separately listed. It is important to identify and distinguish the various activities required for the completion of the project and list them separately.

2. Once the list of various activities is ready the order of precedence for these jobs has to be determined. We must see which jobs have to be completed before others can be started. Obviously, certain jobs will have to be done first.

    Many jobs may be done simultaneously and certain jobs will be dependent upon the successful completion of the earlier jobs. All these relationships between the various jobs have to be clearly laid down.

3. The next step is to draw a picture or a graph which portrays each of these jobs and shows the predecessor and successor relations among them. It shows which job comes first and which next. It also shows the time required for completion of various jobs. This is known as the project graph or the arrow diagram.

# Advantages of Pert
The following advantages are derived from the pert:

1. It compels managers to plan their projects critically and analyse all factors affecting the progress of the plan. The process of the network analysis requires that the project planning be conducted on considerable detail from the start to the finish.

2. It provides the management a tool for forecasting the impact of schedule changes and be prepared to correct such situations. The likely trouble spots are located early enough so as to apply some preventive measures or corrective actions.

3. a lot of data can be presented in a highly ordered fashion. The task relationships are graphically represented for easier evaluation and individuals in different locations can easily determine their role in the total task requirements.

4. The PERT time (Te) is based upon 3-way estimate and hence is the most objective time in the light of uncertainties and results in greater degree of accuracy in time forecasting.

5. It results in improved communication; the network provides a common ground for various parties such as designers, contractors, project managers etc. and they must all understand each other’s role and contributions.

The network will highlight areas that require attention of higher priority so that concentration can be applied to the key jobs without ignoring the lower priority tasks. This gives the management an opportunity to shift attention to any critical task so that the entire project is completed in time.

# Limitations of Pert

Some of the limitations and problems that arise are:

1. Uncertainly about the estimate of time and resources. These must be assumed and the results can only be as good as the assumptions.

2. The costs may be higher than the conventional methods of planning and control. Because of the nature of net working and net work analysis, it needs a high degree of planning skill and greater amount of details which would increase the cost in time and manpower resources,

3. It is not suitable for relatively simple and repetitive processes such as assembly line work which are fixed-sequence jobs.

Hence PERT is not very effective in manufacturing operations, since it deals in the time domain only and does not deal with the quality information which is necessary in manufacturing processes.
