As a marketing strategy, market segmentation is designed to help companies better market to groups that they will have the most success at meeting their needs. Market segmentation helps companies create a market mix that allows them to target their marketing campaigns to audiences that are more likely to need their product - and, potentially find under-served segments to branch out to. 

By more narrowly targeting their key markets, companies are able to be more efficient with their resources - including money and time - when mounting campaigns to draw new customers. 

# Market Segmentation Definition

Market segmentation is the process of dividing prospective consumers into different groups depending on factors like demographics, behavior and various characteristics. Market segmentation helps companies better understand and market to specific groups of consumers that have similar interests, needs and habits.

In each market segment, there are typically three things that are common to all segments - homogeneity, distinctiveness and reaction.

In each individual group, the potential customers are generally homogeneous - meaning they are generally fairly similar in terms of their common needs. Additionally, the members of each individual grouping are distinct from the other groups - or, they are different in some ways than customers in other groupings. Lastly, consumers in each group have similar (or relatively similar) reactions to various marketing, advertising and products directed at their segment, and tend to perceive the full value of products differently than others in different groups. 

# Factors of Market Segmentation 
What goes into the process of market segmentation? 

There are several factors that a company or business will need to examine during the market segmenting process - including how accessible the segments are and specific identification parameters.

For example, companies need to be able to clearly identify different segments of potential consumers. Additionally, the measurability of the segment's size is important to understand how best to plan a strategy, as is the segment's accessibility regarding promotional or marketing materials. 

Moreover, to support the strategy, the strategy must be appropriate for the resources of the particular company and in line with their policies. 

# Types of Market Segmentation

But what types of market segmentation are there? How can companies divide their prospective markets? 

In general, there are four basic types of market segmentation (with some variation in them) - behavioral, demographic, psychographic and geographic. 

## Behavioral

As the name may suggest, behavioral market segmentation is focused on how consumers interact with a product, or how much they know about a product. 

For example, behavioral segmentation could include what brands consumers are loyal to, how sensitive consumers are to certain prices, their usage or certain decision-making processes. Behavioral also includes occasion, engagement and life cycle. 

Behavioral marketing is often employed most during Christmas or holiday shopping seasons when consumer behavior is somewhat altered. 

## Demographic

One of the major ways to segment the market is by demographics. Marketers often segment consumers into groups based on similar age, gender, family size, religion, nationality, income and education level. These are often helpful ways for businesses to better assess what might interest their prospective consumers and better target them based on more narrowed needs. 

An example of demographic market segmentation could be marketing a retirement service to older citizens. 

## Psychographic

With psychographic segmentation, companies examine consumer's lifestyles, personality, interests, opinions, social class, habits and activities to better ascertain their needs. 

For example, a consumer who is very active with outdoor activities like camping, hiking and skiing would more likely be interested in tents, hiking boots and ski shoes than someone who spends lots of time reading indoors. In marketing, much of this information is procured through surveys or other data that give a company a better picture of a consumer's lifestyle and interests to better target their specific niches. 

## Geographic

Geographic information about consumers can be very helpful (and even essential) to marketing to the right groups. Geographic market segmenting takes into account what country, region, city or area a potential consumer resides in. However, it may also encompass the density of a city, population, climate and language to help further group consumers. 

For example, marketing to Spanish-speaking consumers would be very different than marketing to English-speaking consumers. Or, a company selling heaters would likely need to know where their customers in colder climates were as opposed to those in warmer climates who may have less need of their product.

# Market Segmentation Examples 
Here are some actual examples of market segmentation. 

One example of market segmentation in action is Victoria's Secret and their teenage-targeting brand PINK. Victoria's Secret primarily targets women, while their brand PINK is targeted more toward teenage girls and women. However, the brand has also long marketed itself to men - usually husbands or boyfriends of women who are looking to purchase gifts. Given the brand's pricing, Victoria's Secret also targets a relatively affluent segment with additional income to spend on lingerie or mid-price undergarments. 

Apple (AAPL) - Get Report has made its fortune by segmenting the overall electronics market into primarily early adapters and affluent market segments. 

Another good example of market segmentation is the banking industry - like Wells Fargo (WFC) - Get Report or JP Morgan Chase (JPM) - Get Report . Both are large banks with a multitude of different products that require market segmentation to best market them individually. For example, JP Morgan Chase would not likely market 401(k)s or IRAs to college-aged customers - instead, banks may focus on a 30- to 40-year-old demographic, or even senior citizens. 

Additionally, certain food brands or grocery stores like Whole Foods typically segment their market into more health-conscious consumers who are willing to pay more for organic or naturally-sourced food products and groceries. 

While the list goes on, market segmentation may include multiple types of segmentation (like geographic or behavioral) and cover a wide variety of needs. 

# Benefits of Market Segmentation 
While market segmentation is, in essence, essential to a business' success in focusing their resources on marketing to the right groups, there are several other benefits of market segmentation.

For one, market segmentation helps companies zero in their resources on areas where they have a better chance of success. Instead of marketing to an entire group of people in need of jackets, a sportswear company like Nike (NKE) - Get Report could market to people in need of water-resistant running jackets - who would likely fall into a sporty, active lifestyle market segment. 

Another major benefit of market segmentation is its usefulness in helping companies narrow their message to be more unique for specific consumers. Instead of sending out generic, mass marketing messages or advertising, market segmentation allows companies to customize messages to niche audiences that are more likely to be in need of the specific product that company is offering. This can boost customer acquisition through advertising and keep costs lower. 

Market segmentation also helps companies identify underserved markets that may be able to help them expand into new territory - and grow their profits.

In fact, according to a 2008 study by Bain & Company, 81% of executives attributed market segmentation as an essential component to growing profits. 

Given its numerous advantages, market segmentation is a major marketing strategy used by the most successful companies. 

## Determining market opportunities:

Market segmentation enables to identify market opportuÂ­nities. The marketer can study the needs of each segment in the light of current offerings by the competitors. From such study, the marketer can find out the current satisfaction of customers.

Segments with low level of satisfaction from present offering may represent excellent market opportunities. For example, customers may not be satisfied with the current offering of water purifiers in terms of product or after-sale service. Such situation enables a marketer to launch a new range of water purifiers and market them well.

## Adjustments in marketing appeals:

Sellers can make best possible adjustments of their product and marketing appeals. Instead of one marketing programme aimed to draw in all potential buyÂ­ers, sellers can create separate marketing programmes designed to satisfy the needs of different customers. Proper advertising and sales promotional appeals can be made depending on the target audience.

## Developing marketing programmes:

Companies can develop marketing programmes and budÂ­gets based on a clearer idea of the response characteristics of specific market segments. They can budget funds to different segments depending on their buying response.

## Designing a product:

Market segmentation helps in designing products that really match the demands of the target audience. Products with high market potential can be designed and directed to meet the satisfaction of the target market.

### Media selection:

It helps in selection of advertising media more intelligently and in allocating funds to various media. The funds are allocated to various media depending on the target audiÂ­ence, impact of the media, competitor advertising, and so on.

## Timing of marketing efforts:

It helps in setting the timings of the promotional efforts so that more emphasis is placed during those periods when response is likely to be at its peak. For instance, consumer goods can be heavily advertised to Christians during Christmas season and to Hindus during Diwali time.

## Efficient use of resources:

By tailoring marketing programme to individual market segments, management can do a better marketing job and make more efficient use of the marketing resources. For example, a small firm can effectively use its limited resources â money, sales force, etc. â in one or two segmented markets rather than unsuccessfully aiming at a wider market.

## Better service to customers:

Market segmentation enables a company to concentrate its marketÂ­ing efforts in a particular market area, thereby, providing a better service to the target customers. Proper marketing segmentation can facilitate customer satisfaction.

## Helps in fixing prices:

The marketing segmentation also enables to fix prices of the goods and services. Since different market segments have different price perceptions, it is necessary to adopt different pricing strategies for the markets. For instance, the prices for lower-income groups have to be lower and the product and promotional efforts are adjusted accordingly.

## Assist in distribution strategies:

Segmentation also assists in adopting suitable distribution strategies. Different market segments may require different distribution mix. For example, if the product is of very high quality intended to target the upper class, then it must be distributed at prestigious outlets located at selective places.

# 7 Ps of Marketing

Marketing can be defined as the set of controllable marketing variable that is the four Ps of marketing (Product, Price, Place and Promotion) that the firm blends to produce the response it wants in the target market.
The marketing includes everything the firm can do to influence the demand for its product.
The marketing is the combination of product, price, place and promotion for any business venture.

No one element of the marketing is more important than another â each element ideally supports the other. Firms modify each element in the marketing to establish an overall brand image and unique selling point that makes their products stand out from the competition.
The 7Ps of marketing are as follows:-

1. [The Service Package (Product)](##product)

2. [Pricing Policy](##Prices)
 
3. [Promotional Programmes](##Promotion)

4. [Place â Distribution](##Place)

5. [Packaging](##Packaging)

6. [Positioning](##Positioning)

7. [People](##People)


Take charge of your marketing efforts and beat the competition with this simple formula.

Once youâve developed your marketing strategy, there is a âSeven P Formulaâ you should use to continually evaluate and reevaluate your business activities. These seven are- product, price, promotion, place, packaging, positioning and people. As products, markets, customers and needs change rapidly, you must continually revisit these seven Ps to make sure youâre on track and achieving the maximum results possible for you in todayâs marketplace.

## Product

To begin with, develop the habit of looking at your product as though you were an outside marketing consultant brought in to help your company decide whether or not itâs in the right business at this time. Ask critical questions such as,
> âIs your current product or service, or mix of products and services, appropriate and suitable for the market and the customers of today?â

Whenever youâre having difficulty selling as much of your products or services as youâd like, you need to develop the habit of assessing your business honestly and asking,

> âAre these the right products or services for our customers today?â

Is there any product or service youâre offering today that, knowing what you now know, you would not bring out again today? Compared to your competitors, is your product or service superior in some significant way to anything else available? If so, what is it? If not, could you develop an area of superiority? Should you be offering this product or service at all in the current marketplace?

## Prices

The second P in the formula is price. Develop the habit of continually examining and reexamining the prices of the products and services you sell to make sure theyâre still appropriate to the realities of the current market. Sometimes you need to lower your prices. At other times, it may be appropriate to raise your prices.
Many companies have found that the profitability of certain products or services doesnât justify the amount of effort and resources that go into producing them. By raising their prices, they may lose a percentage of their customers, but the remaining percentage generates a profit on every sale. Could this be appropriate for you?

Sometimes you need to change your terms and conditions of sale. Sometimes, by spreading your price over a series of months or years, you can sell far more than you are today, and the interest you can charge will more than make up for the delay in cash receipts. Sometimes you can combine products and services together with special offers and special promotions. Sometimes you can include free additional items that cost you very little to produce but make your prices appear far more attractive to your customers.

In business, as in nature, whenever you experience resistance or frustration in any part of your sales or marketing activities, be open to revisiting that area. Be open to the possibility that your current pricing structure is not ideal for the current market. Be open to the need to revise your prices, if necessary, to remain competitive, to survive and thrive in a fast-changing marketplace.

## Promotion

The third habit in marketing and sales is to think in terms of promotion all the time. Promotion includes all the ways you tell your customers about your products or services and how you then market and sell to them.

Small changes in the way you promote and sell your products can lead to dramatic changes in your results. Even small changes in your advertising can lead immediately to higher sales. Experienced copywriters can often increase the response rate from advertising by 500 percent by simply changing the headline on an advertisement.

Large and small companies in every industry continually experiment with different ways of advertising, promoting, and selling their products and services. And here is the rule- Whatever method of marketing and sales youâre using today will, sooner or later, stop working.
Sometimes it will stop working for reasons you know, and sometimes it will be for reasons you donât know. In either case, your methods of marketing and sales will eventually stop working, and youâll have to develop new sales, marketing and advertising approaches, offerings, and strategies.

## Place

The fourth P in the marketing mix is the place where your product or service is actually sold. Develop the habit of reviewing and reflecting upon the exact location where the customer meets the salesperson. Sometimes a change in place can lead to a rapid increase in sales.
You can sell your product in many different places. Some companies use direct selling, sending their salespeople out to personally meet and talk with the prospect. Some sell by telemarketing. Some sell through catalogs or mail order. Some sell at trade shows or in retail establishments. Some sell in joint ventures with other similar products or services. Some companies use manufacturersâ representatives or distributors. Many companies use a combination of one or more of these methods.

In each case, the entrepreneur must make the right choice about the very best location or place for the customer to receive essential buying information on the product or service needed to make a buying decision. What is yours? In what way should you change it? Where else could you offer your products or services?

## Packaging

The fifth element in the marketing mix is the packaging. Develop the habit of standing back and looking at every visual element in the packaging of your product or service through the eyes of a critical prospect. Remember, people form their first impression about you within the first 30 seconds of seeing you or some element of your company. Small improvements in the packaging or external appearance of your product or service can often lead to completely different reactions from your customers.

With regard to the packaging of your company, your product or service, you should think in terms of everything that the customer sees from the first moment of contact with your company all the way through the purchasing process.

Packaging refers to the way your product or service appears from the outside. Packaging also refers to your people and how they dress and groom. It refers to your offices, your waiting rooms, your brochures, your correspondence and every single visual element about your company. Everything counts. Everything helps or hurts. Everything affects your customerâs confidence about dealing with you.

When IBM started under the guidance of Thomas J. Watson, Sr., he very early concluded that fully 99 percent of the visual contact a customer would have with his company, at least initially, would be represented by IBM salespeople. Because IBM was selling relatively sophisticated high-tech equipment, Watson knew customers would have to have a high level of confidence in the credibility of the salesperson. He therefore instituted a dress and grooming code that became an inflexible set of rules and regulations within IBM.

As a result, every salesperson was required to look like a professional in every respect. Every element of their clothing-including dark suits, dark ties, white shirts, conservative hairstyles, shined shoes, clean fingernails-and every other feature gave off the message of professionalism and competence. One of the highest compliments a person could receive was, âYou look like someone from IBM.â

## Positioning

The next P is positioning. You should develop the habit of thinking continually about how you are positioned in the hearts and minds of your customers. How do people think and talk about you when youâre not present? How do people think and talk about your company? What positioning do you have in your market, in terms of the specific words people use when they describe you and your offerings to others?

In the famous book by A1 Reis and Jack Trout, Positioning, the authors point out that how you are seen and thought about by your customers is the critical determinant of your success in a competitive marketplace. Attribution theory says that most customers think of you in terms of a single attribute, either positive or negative.

Sometimes itâs âservice.â Sometimes itâs âexcellence.â Sometimes itâs âquality engineering,â as with Mercedes Benz. Sometimes itâs âthe ultimate driving machine,â as with BMW. In every case, how deeply entrenched that attribute is in the minds of your customers and prospective customers determines how readily theyâll buy your product or service and how much theyâll pay.

Develop the habit of thinking about how you could improve your positioning. Begin by determining the position youâd like to have. If you could create the ideal impression in the hearts and minds of your customers, what would it be? What would you have to do in every customer interaction to get your customers to think and talk about in that specific way? What changes do you need to make in the way interact with customers today in order to be seen as the very best choice for your customers of tomorrow?

## People
The final P of the marketing mix is people. Develop the habit of thinking in terms of the people inside and outside of your business who are responsible for every element of your sales and marketing strategy and activities.

Itâs amazing how many entrepreneurs and businesspeople will work extremely hard to think through every element of the marketing strategy and the marketing mix, and then pay little attention to the fact that every single decision and policy has to be carried out by a specific person, in a specific way. Your ability to select, recruit, hire and retain the proper people, with the skills and abilities to do the job you need to have done, is more important than everything else put together.

In his best-selling book, Good to Great, Jim Collins discovered the most important factor applied by the best companies was that they first of all âgot the right people on the bus, and the wrong people off the bus.â Once these companies had hired the right people, the second step was to âget the right people in the right seats on the bus.â

To be successful in business, you must develop the habit of thinking in terms of exactly who is going to carry out each task and responsibility. In many cases, itâs not possible to move forward until you can attract and put the right person into the right position. Many of the best business plans ever developed sit on shelves today because the [people who created them] could not find the key people who could execute those plans.
