## Marginal Costing ##

# Meaning of Marginal Costing

Marginal costing is `“The ascertainment, by differentiating between fixed cost and variable cost, of marginal cost and of the effect on profit of changes in volume or type of output”`.

Under this technique all costs are classified into fixed costs and variable costs.

Only variable costs are considered product costs and are allocated to products manufactured. These costs include direct materials, direct labour, direct expenses and variable overhead. Fixed costs are not considered for computing the cost of products or valuation of inventory.

Fixed costs are mostly concerned with the period, hence they are called period costs and are written-off in the Costing Profit and Loss Account of the period in which they are incurred.

# Features of Marginal Costing

The main features of marginal costing may be summed up as:

1. This technique is used to ascertain the marginal cost and to know the impact of variable costs on the volume of output.

2. All costs are classified on the basis of variability into fixed cost and variable cost. Semi-variable costs are segregated into fixed and variable costs.

3. Marginal (i.e., variable) costs are treated as the cost of the product or service. Fixed costs are charged to Costing Profit and Loss Account of the period in which they are incurred.

4. Stock of finished goods and work-in-progress are valued on the basis of marginal costs.

5. Selling price is based on marginal cost plus contribution.

6. Profit is calculated in the usual manner. When marginal cost is deducted from sales it gives rise to contribution. When fixed cost is deducted from contribution it results in profit.

7. Break-even analysis and cost-volume profit analysis are integral parts of this tech­nique.

8. The relative profitability of products or departments is based on the contribution made available by each department or product.

# Advantages of Marginal Costing

The advantages claimed for marginal costing are:-

1. The technique is simple to understand and easy to operate because it avoids the complexities of apportionment of fixed costs which, is really, arbitrary.

2. It also avoids the carry forward of a portion of the current period’s fixed overhead to the subsequent period. As such cost and profit are not vitiated. Cost comparisons become more meaningful.

3. The technique provides useful data for managerial decision-making.

4. There is no problem of over or under-absorption of overheads.

5. The impact of profit on sales fluctuations are clearly shown under marginal costing.

6. The technique can be used along with other techniques such as budgetary control and standard costing.

7. It establishes a clear relationship between cost, sales and volume of output and break­even analysis.

8. It shows the relative contributions to profit which are made by each of a number of products, and shows where the sales effort should be concentrated.

9. Stock of finished goods and work-in-progress are valued at marginal cost, which is uniform.

# Limitations of Marginal Costing

Marginal costing suffers from the following limitations:

1. Segregation of costs into fixed and variable elements involves considerable technical difficulty.

2. The linear relationship between output and variable costs may not be true at different levels of activity. In reality, neither the fixed costs remain constant nor do the variable costs vary in proportion to the level of activity.

3. The value of stock cannot be accepted by taxation authorities since it deflates profit.

4. This technique cannot be applied in the case of contract costing where the value of work-in-progress will always be high.

5. This technique also cannot be used in the case of cost plus contracts unless fixed costs and profits are considered.

6. Pricing decisions cannot be based on contribution alone.

7. The elimination of fixed costs renders cost comparison of jobs difficult.

8. The distinction between fixed and variable costs holds good only in the short run. In the long run, however, all costs are variable.

9. With the increased use of automatic machinery, the proportion of fixed costs increases. A system which ignores fixed costs is, therefore, less effective.

10. The technique need not be considered to be unique from the point of cost control.
