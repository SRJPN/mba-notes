# Political Factors Affect Business Environment

There are many external environment factors affect business negatively and positively. Business managers must address these factors and make decisions that minimize the impact of external environment. These factors include political factors, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental also known as PESTLE Analysis.

Political factors and environment of a country impacts any business organization and can also introduce a risk factor can cause the business to suffer losses or compromise over its profit stream. Political environment can change because of the policies and actions of the prevailing government at every level, federal to local level. It is very important that a business should plan for the variability in the policies and regulations of the government to maintain a stable business environment.

# Definition

Political factors are government regulations that influence business operations positively and negatively. Managers must keep a bird&#39;s eye view over political factors. These factors may be current and impending legislation, political stability and changes, freedom of speech, protection and discrimination laws are factors affecting business operation and activities

# How Political Factors Affecting Business Environment

Political factors can impact a business by making the [**market environment**](https://www.marketingtutor.net/marketing-environment-definition-factors-and-examples/) more or less friendly for that business. Typically, governments have a great deal of power over businesses and many times, there is not much that businesses can do about it.

Political factors can impact businesses in various ways. These external environmental factors can add in a risk factor which can lead to a major loss in business. These factors can change the entire results and hence, companies should be able to deal with both local as well as international political outcomes.

In addition to this, political factors not only have a direct impact but, it also impacts other factors as well which can have a significant effect on the business and its operating environment. There are certain factors that create inter-linkages in several ways like:

- Political decisions affect the socio-cultural environment of the country.
- Political decisions have an impact on the economic environment.
- Politicians can also influence the acceptance of new technologies.
- Politicians can also influence the rate of development of new technologies.

# What Political Factors Affect Business Environment

With a change in administration policies, there arise political factors that can change the entire business scenario. These changes can be economic, legal or social and can include the following factors:

- **Tax and economic policies:** Increasing or decreasing rate of taxes is a good example of a political component. Government regulations may raise the tax rate for some businesses and can lower the same for others due to specific reasons. This decision will directly impact businesses. This is why maintaining a strategy which can deal with such situations is very important.

- **Political stability:** Lack of political stability within a country can significantly impact the operations of a business. This can especially be true for businesses that are operating on a global scale. For instance, a hostile takeover can take over a government. Eventually, such a situation will lead to looting, riots and general disorder within the environment. Such situations can disrupt business operations and activities which can have a major impact on its bottom line.
- **Foreign Trade Regulations:** Every business has a need to expand business operations to other countries. However, political background of a country can influence the desire for a business to expand its operations. Tax policies that are particularly controlled by the government can induce a particular business to expand operations in different regions whereas; other tax policies can hinder the process of business expansion for some industries. Government initiatives, which have been designed to support local businesses, might work against international companies when the question is of their competitiveness in a foreign region.
- **Employment Laws:** Employment laws are made to protect the rights of employees and include every aspect of employer/employee relationship. Employment law is an aspect that is very complex and involves several pitfalls as well. When businesses&#39; are in touch with the latest developments in this law, they can manage to take their business in the right direction however, those who get it wrong needs to be completely prepared for the expensive results it will generate. In modern corporations, employees are almost 98% of the company for the accomplishments or lack thereof and any changes within employment law will, of course, have a great impact on the business operations.

# Example Political Factors Affecting Nike

Conducting a macro environment analysis, a good example of how political factors have affected a business can be associated with Nike. Nike is a globally recognized athletic apparel, footwear, sports accessories and equipment. Nike has been very fortunate as the government of the United States have formulated such policies that will foster the growth of businesses. The company is enjoying stable currency and low-interest rate conditions along with very competitive tax arrangements that help the company in advancing growth. US government has taken initiatives with respect to transparency in the global value chain and Nike has greatly benefited from this. However, Nike is facing hard times in its outsourced manufacturers in other regions like Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam where there is an increase in political unrest.

# Macro Environment – Economic Environment

Macro environment refers to certain external factors that affect a firm and its business. Such factors are not a part of the firm&#39;s immediate surroundings and cannot be controlled by them. One such type of macro factor is the economic environment in which the business operates. Let us have a look.

**Economic Environment**

The economic environment is the sum total of the economic conditions and the nature of the economy in which the business has to operate and compete. This will include the nature of the economy, the direction in which it is progressing, the availability of resources (labour, capital, etc) and the conditions of the market as well. All these factors in combination create the economic environment for a firm.

The economic environment will dictate a lot of the decisions of the firm. The size of the market will depend on the economic environment. The purchasing power of a potential customer will also depend on factors of the economic environment like income levels, savings, credit availability, etc.

**Factors Affecting the Economic Environment**

The firm has no control over the economic environment in which it must operate. It is an external macro factor. While it cannot be controlled by the firm it can be studied. So it is important to know the factors which affect the economic environment and how they may impact the firms.

1] Economic Systems

The economic system under which the economy operates has a huge impact on its economic environment. Let us take a look at the three economic systems which usually prevail

- Capitalist Economy: There are no restrictions in a capitalist economy. The market forces operate freely, demand and supply will decide the prices in the market. There is private ownership of factors of production and private companies.
- Socialist Economy: This type of economy is characterized by government control and central planning authority. So there is no private ownership, all means of production are under state control. There are no market forces and the price is also set by the state.
- Mixed Economy: Here the best features of both capitalism and socialism combine to give us this system. Market forces are very much in force to decide demand supply and prices. But there is some government oversight to ensure that there are no discriminatory practices.

2] Economic Conditions

The economic conditions of the country also have a huge impact on the firms that exist within the economy. Furthermore, economic conditions are the sum total of many factors that can greatly affect a business. Such factors include GDP of the economy, per capita income, availability of capital, utilization of resources, state of the capital market, interest rates, unemployment levels, etc.

3] Economic Policies

In any economy, the government has some control and/or oversight. Moreover, governments with the help of their planning authorities frame and implement many types of economic policies.

- Industrial Policy: These are all rules, laws, notifications, policies, circulars, etc through which the government controls and governs the industrial sector of the economy. This helps them shape the industrial development of the country.
- Fiscal Policy: This is the government policy with regard to public expenditure, taxation, and public debt. This also greatly affects the businesses functioning in the economy.
- Monetary Policy: This policy will decide the supply of money to the market. Consequently, will decide the levels of savings and investments. It will also control the credit supply in the economy.
- Foreign Investment Policy: This deals with keeping the foreign investments in-check for all sectors. So, we can benefit from the new technologies in all sectors.
- Import Export Policy: This is how the government controls the export and imports of a country. Also, the import-export policies will lay out the duties, taxes, subsidies, etc. These days there are not many barriers to import and export which positively affects the economic environment.

## Objectives of Consumer Protection Act

## This Act aimed at getting accurate information on the Quality ,Quantity, Purity, Price and Standard of the products

- Ensures the consumer, the right to seek redressal against any exploitation
- In order to protect consumers from unfair trade practices

**The principal objective of the**  **Consumer Protection Act**  **is to grant shield for the improved safeguard to consumers. Unlike prevailing laws, which are disciplinary or precautionary in nature, the provisions of this Act are compensatory in nature. The act is aimed to afford simple, quick and economical redressal to the consumers&#39; grievances, and reliefs of a particular nature and award of damages wherever appropriate to the consumer.**

The _Consumer Protection Act_ has been revised in 1993 both to extend its coverage and scope and to augment the powers of the redressal.

## Rights of Consumer As Per The Protection Act

The fundamental rights of consumers as per the Consumer Protection Act are:

1. Right to be shielded against promotion of goods and services which are risky to life and property
2. Right to be conversant regarding the wholesomeness, standard ,quality, quantity, potency, and value of goods, or services so as to shield the buyer against unfair trade practices
3. Right to be ensured,  access to range of goods and services at viable prices wherever possible
4. Right to be informed and be ensured that consumers&#39; benefit will be given due consideration at appropriate level
5. Right to search for redressal against unjust trade practices or restraining trade practices or deceitful exploitation of consumers
6. Right to consumer education

##
# Objectives of

# Consumer Protection Act

The main objective of the Consumer Protection Act is to grant shield for the improved safeguard of consumers and their rights. Even though there is a prevailing Consumer Protection Act, it is still doubtful as to how far the objectives of the [Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Protection_Act,_1986. are  achieved.

Still we see that Rights of consumers are ignored but we hope the government will surely take necessary actions in order to establish the proclaimed fundamental rights soon. Government must ensure consumers right to be conversant regarding the purity, standard ,quality, quantity, potency, and value of goods, or services so as to shield the buyer against unfair trade practices.

**Problems of**  **Consumer Protection Act**  **1986:**

The following are a few  examples  as to  how  companies  are  involved  in  unfair  trade practices  in  order  to  attract  consumers. Few emerging issues related to the _Consumer Protection Act 1986_ are:

1. Unfair trade Practices: There are many unfair trade practices among the companies, if those practices cannot be stopped, the objectives of the _Consumer Protection Act_ 1986 will be difficult to achieve.

2. Spurious or Duplicate Goods: Numbers of fake companies very often imitate the design, color and shape and outlook of the original brand which is opposed to consumer rights. For example Fair & Lovely is imitated as Fairy & Lovely, Life Buoy as Life Boy etc.

3. Misleading  TV commercials are misleading; as because real promise of product is miles away from TV ads.

4. Gimmick of Warranty and Guaranty: There is no true warranty or guarantee at all. Many consumers do not know the legal essence of these two terms.

5. Pricing: Pricing is out of control and reach of the consumers. Most  of  the  consumers are  not  aware  about  the  essence  of  star  (\*)  which  means &quot;Conditions Apply&quot;. This means that the quoted price is applicable only upon happening of an event.

The other challenges consumer protection act 1986 are:

6. Recycled or Renovated Goods

7. Bogus Telemarketing

8. Unsecured Internet-Banking, etc.

# Advantages and problems of privatisation

Privatisation involves selling state-owned assets to the private sector. It is argued the private sector tends to run a business more efficiently because of the profit motive. However, critics argue private firms can exploit their monopoly power and ignore wider social costs. Privatisation is often achieved through listing the new private company on the stock market. In the 1980s and 1990s, the UK privatised many previously state-owned industries such as BP, BT, British Airways, electricity companies, gas companies and rail network.

Arguments for and against privatisation

|   | Privitisation | Nationalisation |
|---|---|---|
| Ownership | Firm owned by private sector | Firm owned and managed by government |
| Incentives | Profit motive acts as incentive for owners and managers | Workers feel motivated if they feel company belongs to them |
| Externalities | Private firm may ignore external cost and external benefits | Government can put social benefits above profit motive |
| Efficiency | Incentive to introduce new technology and increase labour productivity | Nationalised firms find it hard to sack surplus workers. |
| Knowledge | Private firm employ managers with best skills | Politicians may interfere based on political motives |
| Natural Monopolies | Private monopolies. Eg: water / Trains may charge higher prices | Government can set prices based on social factor | 
| Depends on industry | Worked well for BT, BA | Natural monopolies like water, trains and Non-profit services like health care |

# Potential benefits of privatisation

1. **Improved efficiency**

The main argument for privatisation is that private companies have a profit incentive to cut costs and be more efficient. If you work for a government run industry, managers do not usually share in any profits. However, a private firm is interested in making a profit, and so it is more likely to cut costs and be efficient. Since privatisation, companies such as BT, and British Airways have shown degrees of improved efficiency and higher profitability.

2. **Lack of political interference**

It is argued governments make poor economic managers. They are motivated by political pressures rather than sound economic and business sense. For example, a state enterprise may employ surplus workers which is inefficient. The government may be reluctant to get rid of the workers because of the negative publicity involved in job losses. Therefore, state-owned enterprises often employ too many workers increasing inefficiency.

3. **Short term view**

A government many think only in terms of the next election. Therefore, they may be unwilling to invest in infrastructure improvements which will benefit the firm in the long term because they are more concerned about projects that give a benefit before the election.

4. **Shareholders**

It is argued that a private firm has pressure from shareholders to perform efficiently. If the firm is inefficient then the firm could be subject to a takeover. A state-owned firm doesn&#39;t have this pressure and so it is easier for them to be inefficient.

5. **Increased competition**

Often privatisation of state-owned monopolies occurs alongside deregulation – i.e. policies to allow more firms to enter the industry and increase the competitiveness of the market. It is this increase in competition that can be the greatest spur to improvements in efficiency. For example, there is now more competition in telecoms and distribution of gas and electricity.

However, privatisation doesn&#39;t necessarily increase competition; it depends on the nature of the market. E.g. there is no competition in tap water because it is a [natural monopoly](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/natural-monopoly/). There is also very little competition within the rail industry.

6. **Government will raise revenue from the sale**

Selling state-owned assets to the private sector raised significant sums for the UK government in the 1980s. However, this is a one-off benefit. It also means we lose out on future dividends from the profits of public companies.

Disadvantages of privatisation

1. **Natural monopoly**

A natural monopoly occurs when the most efficient number of firms in an industry is one. For example, tap water has very significant fixed costs. Therefore there is no scope for having competition amongst several firms. Therefore, in this case, privatisation would just create a private monopoly which might seek to set higher prices which exploit consumers. Therefore it is better to have a public monopoly rather than a private monopoly which can exploit the consumer.

2. **Public interest**

There are many industries which perform an important public service, e.g., health care, education and public transport. In these industries, the profit motive shouldn&#39;t be the primary objective of firms and the industry. For example, in the case of health care, it is feared privatising health care would mean a greater priority is given to profit rather than patient care. Also, in an industry like health care, arguably we don&#39;t need a profit motive to improve standards. When doctors treat patients, they are unlikely to try harder if they get a bonus.

3. **Government loses out on potential dividends**.

Many of the privatised companies in the UK are quite profitable. This means the government misses out on their dividends, instead going to wealthy shareholders.

4. **Problem of regulating private monopolies**.

Privatisation creates private monopolies, such as the water companies and rail companies. These need regulating to prevent abuse of monopoly power. Therefore, there is still need for government regulation, similar to under state ownership.

5. **Fragmentation of industries**

In the UK, rail privatisation led to breaking up the rail network into infrastructure and train operating companies. This led to areas where it was unclear who had responsibility. For example, the Hatfield rail crash was blamed on no one taking responsibility for safety. Different rail companies has increased the complexity of rail tickets.

6. **Short-termism of firms.**

As well as the government being motivated by short term pressures, this is something private firms may do as well. To please shareholders they may seek to increase short term profits and avoid investing in long term projects. For example, the UK is suffering from a lack of investment in new energy sources; the privatised companies are trying to make use of existing plants rather than invest in new ones.

Evaluation of privatisation

- It depends on the industry in question. An industry like telecoms is a typical industry where the incentive of profit can help increase efficiency. However, if you apply it to industries like health care or public transport the profit motive is less important.
- It depends on the quality of regulation. Do regulators make the privatised firms meet certain standards of service and keep prices low?
- Is the market contestable and competitive? Creating a private monopoly may harm consumer interests, but if the market is highly competitive, there is greater scope for efficiency savings.

# Environmental Factors Affect Business

Marketing strategy is a very important aspect of making a business successful. The absence of a clear strategy, setting up meaningful objectives and goals can be very difficult. While drafting a Marketing strategy, [**conducting a macro environment analysis**](https://www.marketingtutor.net/marketing-environmental-analysis/) within which the business is operating will help in determining the outcomes of a strategy. This analysis includes political, economic, social-cultural, technological, legal and environmental factors that affect business.

To analyze the six macro factors, we conduct [**PESTLE analysis**](https://www.marketingtutor.net/what-is-pestle-analysis-tool/) and [**SWOT analysis**](https://www.marketingtutor.net/swot-analysis-strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats/). These strategic analysis tools consider all the factors that may affect the business operations.  This is worth mentioning that PESTLE analysis responds to external factors while SWOT analysis responds to both internal and external factors to the organization.

# Definition of Environmental Factors

Environmental factors can be explained as identifiable elements within the cultural, economic, demographic, physical, technological or [**political environment which impacts the growth**](https://www.marketingtutor.net/political-factors-affect-business/), operations and survival of an organization. Environmental factors can be both internal as well external for the business. External factors can include economic and technological factors whereas; internal factors may include value system, objectives or internal relationships of a business.

# How Environmental Factors Affect Business

Every business, whether large or small, is affected not only from internal organizational factors but, from several external factors. [**Company have no control on external environment**](https://www.marketingtutor.net/external-factors-affect-business/). Developing marketing strategies should include considering **environmental factors** so an accurate picture of the market trends and environment can be presented and to understand as to where the company is standing. Ignoring environmental aspects is similar to walking on a path where there are unsuccessful marketing and lost revenues which can ultimately impact the health of the business brand.

# Examples of Environmental Factors Affecting Business

**Environmental Policies.** Environmental policies are another external factor that can impact the strategy of a business. Environmental policy is the commitment of a business to the regulations, laws as well as other policy mechanisms that are concerned with environmental issues. Environmental policy impacts businesses because the law implies organizations to change their operational procedures and equipment so as to meet those standards which can cost businesses some good amount of money.

**Climate Change.** Climate change became an insidious threat to businesses as its pace can be recognized only when it is taken into consideration on the basis of decade-after-decade. Increasing issue of global warming and adverse weather conditions in the recent few years, it is difficult for companies and organizations to operate equally in every type of weather condition. Businesses that are directly dependent upon adequate water supply e.g., field sports or agriculture will be affected adversely if climatic changes resulted in reduced rainfalls. Even consumers are becoming aware and keen about this factor and are prone towards those brands which are saving the environment or supporting this cause.

**Green Agenda.** Business-related activities impact the environment; however, the environment also has an effect on businesses and the [**market environment**](https://www.marketingtutor.net/marketing-environment-definition-factors-and-examples/). Now enterprises have realized that in order to achieve business goals, there is a need to draft environmental-friendly policies. Green agenda is a plan where enterprises manage their operations in such a way so that there is minimal negative impact on the local or global environment. In order to be environmentally responsible, corporations need to devise plans and procedures in their operations and activities which is beneficial not only company but, for the overall environment as well.

**Pollution.** Pollution can also have an impact over business strategies. Pollution may cause some major environmental events which can result in the disruption of supply chains or an increase in the cost of raw material. Organizations need to monitor such events and develop contingency plans so as to deal with them.

**Availability of natural resources.** Amongst external environment factors, this factor refers to the physical environment of a business. Natural resources are very important for most businesses and many corporations have natural resources as their major raw material. Lack of natural resources can hinder an organization&#39;s producing ability and hence its output.

**Recycling.** Recycling is another aspect of a greener environment. The cost of dumping waste in landfills is increasing and is resulting in not only shortage of wastages but, it also provides harm to the environment. Recycled materials not only results in making the production process cost-effective but, it also helps the business to save some money and helping the environment.

**Waste Disposal.** Although, there has been a positive trend towards recycling of waste materials, still there is several businesses which dump wastage in landfills.  This not only increases their cost of dumping waste but, is also harmful to the environment in which the business operates. Businesses, in order to meet their bottom line, should first look at producing less waste and use fewer resources which will reduce their production cost along with making the corporation sustainable.

# Examples of How Environmental Factors Affect Tesco

Companies are facing increased pressure by government agencies to address environmental issues. furthermore, companies must respond to these issues in ways that benefit society.

Now Tesco encourages its consumer to shop at tesco.com. Tesco Van Drivers will not only use fuel-saving routes but also collect unwanted plastic bags from customers and recycle them.

Also, Tesco is committed to use renewable sources and generate 100% of its electricity by 2030. The company promises to minimize upto 50% carbon footprint by 2020.

5. Technological support must be provided to SSI to import machinery at lower cost.

6. Many industrial estates must be established by the government.

7. The informal [money market](https://accountlearning.com/money-market-meaning-dealers-instruments-constituents-importance/) should be regulated to avoid exploitation by money lenders on small scale industrialists.

8. Training must be provided to entrepreneurs in technological, managerial, financial and marketing areas.

9. Awareness campaigns must be carried out in full swing to encourage youngsters to become first generation entrepreneurs.

10. The sick industries must be rejuvenated instead of liquidation.

11. The licensing procedure must be simple and at ease.

12. Fair Incentives and subsides must be given to SSI units and an awareness must be made about the incentives available to new entrepreneurs

13. [Export promotion schemes](https://accountlearning.com/export-promotion-measures-of-indian-government/) must be devised in such a way that encourages SSI to export their goods.

# 7 Main Features of the New Industrial Policy of India

The major objectives of the new policy are to build on the gains already made, correct the distortions or weaknesses that might have crept in, maintain a sustained growth in productivity and gainful employment, and attain international competitiveness. In pursuit of these objectives, the government announced a series of initiatives in the new industrial policy as outlined below:

1. **Abolition of Industrial Licensing:**

In a major move to liberalise the economy, the new industrial policy abolished all industrial licensing irrespective of the level of in vestment except for certain industries related to security and strategic concerns, and social reasons.

Now there are only 6 industries for which licensing is compulsory as amended in February 1999. These are alcohol, cigarettes, hazardous chemicals, drugs and pharmaceuticals, electronics, aerospace and defense equipments, and industrial explosives.

2. **Public Sector&#39;s Role Diluted:**

The number of industries reserved for the public sector since 1956 was seventeen. This number has now been reduced to three. They are arms and ammunition and allied items of defense equipment, atomic energy and rail transport.

The main elements of Government Policy towards Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) are:

(i) Bring down government equity in all non-strategic PSUs to 26 per cent or lower, if necessary;

(ii) Restructure and revive potentially viable PSUs;

(iii) Close down PSUs which cannot be revived; and

(iv) Fully protect the interests of workers.

3. **Abolition of Phased Manufacturing Programmes:**

Devaluation of currency and increasing FDI led government to liberalise local content requirement for indigenous firms.

4. **MRTP Act:**

MRTP Act has been amended to remove the threshold limits of assets in respect of MRTP companies and dominant undertakings.

The new industrial policy also states that the government will undertake review of the existing public enterprises in low technology, small-scale and non-strategic areas. Sick units will be referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction for advice about rehabilitation and reconstruction.

For enterprises remaining in the public sector it is stated that they will be provided a much greater degree of management autonomy through the system of Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).

5. **Free Entry to Foreign Investment and Technology:**

The Government is committed to promote increased flow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for better technology, modernisation, exports and for providing products and services of international standards.

Therefore, the policy of the Government has been aimed at encouraging foreign investment particularly in core infrastructure sectors so as to supplement national efforts. The salient features of the FDI policy are:

(i) There are two modalities for FDI approval: a) automatic approval by the Reserve Bank, and b) approval by Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB)/Government.

(ii) 34 categories/groups of high priority industries identified on the basis of National Industrial Classification qualify for automatic approval up to 50/51/74/100 per cent FDI depending on the nature of activity.

(iii) Projects for electricity generation, transmission and distribution, and construction and maintenance of roads, highways, vehicular tunnels, vehicular bridges, ports and harbours have permitted foreign equity participation up to 100 per cent under the automatic route.

(iv) FIPB is required to dispose of applications for FDI within a time frame of six weeks.

(v) FDI is not permissible in agriculture, real estate and insurance activities.

(vi) Full repatriation of original investment and returns except for dividend balancing and foreign exchange neutrality conditions in certain sectors.

(vii) Liberal access to foreign technology. Automatic approval to lump sum payment of up to US $2 million and royalty at the rate of 5 per cent for domestic sales and 8 per cent for exports subject to a total payment of 8 per cent on sales for a period not exceeding 7 years from the date of commercial production.

(viii) Easy access to domestic debt. Foreign companies that invest in India can leverage in India by way of domestic debt from domestic financial institutions.

(ix) Liberal external commercial borrowings and debt servicing norms.

(x) No ceiling on raising Global Depository Receipts (GDRs), American Depository Receipts (ADRs), and Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs).

6. **Industrial Location Policy Liberalised:**

The new industrial policy provides that in locations other than cities of more than 1 million populations, there will be no requirement of obtaining industrial approvals from the centre, except for industries subject to compulsory licensing.

In cities with a population of more than 1 million, industries other than those of a non-polluting nature will be located outside 25 kms of the periphery. Since there is 23 cities in India with a population of more than 1 million each, the new industrial policy has dispensed with government clearance for the location of projects except in the case of these 23 cities.

7. **Removal of Mandatory Convertibility Clause:**

A large part of industrial investment in India is financed by loans from banks and financial institutions. These institutions have followed a mandatory practice of including a convertibility clause in their lending operations for new projects.

This has provided them an option of converting part of their loans into equity if felt necessary by their management. The new industrial policy has provided that henceforth financial institutions will not impose this mandatory convertibility clause.

# The 4 Types Of Economic Systems Explained

There are four primary types of economic systems in the world: traditional, command, market and mixed. Each economy has its strengths and weaknesses, its sub-economies and tendencies, and, of course, a troubled history.

Below we examine each system in turn and give ample attention to the attributes listed above. It&#39;s important to understand how different parts of the world function economically, as the economy is one of the strongest forces when it comes to balancing political power, instigating war and delivering a high (or low) quality of life to the people it serves. Anyone interested in economics on a global level should check out this fantastic [**course on the crisis of capitalism and why the global economy is teetering on the verge of collapse.**](https://udemyblog.wpengine.com/capitalism-in-crisis-the-global-economic-crisis-explained/?tc=blog.typesofeconomicsystems)

1. **Traditional Economic System**

A traditional economic system is the best place to start because it is, quite literally, the most traditional and ancient type of economy in the world. There are certain elements of a traditional economy that those in more advanced economies, such as Mixed, would like to see return to prominence.

**Where Tradition Is Cherished:** Traditional economies still produce products and services that are a direct result of their beliefs, customs, traditions, religions, etc. Vast portions of the world still function under a traditional economic system. These areas tend to be rural, second- or third-world, and closely tied to the land, usually through farming. However, there is an increasingly small population of nomadic peoples, and while their economies are certainly traditional, they often interact with other economies in order to sell, trade, barter, etc. Learn about the complexities of globalization and how it shapes economic relationships and affects cultures with this [**great class on the geography of globalization.**](https://udemyblog.wpengine.com/the-geography-of-globalization/?tc=blog.typesofeconomicsystems&amp;couponCode=half-off-for-blog)

**Minimal Waste:** Traditional economies would never, ever, in a million years see the type of profit or surplus that results from a market or mixed economy. In general, surplus is a rare thing. A third-world and/or indigenous country does not have the resources necessary (or if they do, they are controlled by wealthier economies, often by force), and in many cases any surplus is either distributed, wasted, or paid to some authority that has been given power.

**Advantages And Disadvantages:** Certainly one of the most obvious advantages is that tradition and custom is preserved while it is virtually non-existant in market/mixed economies. There is also the fact that each member of a traditional economy has a more specific and pronounced role, and these societies are often very close-knit and socially satisfied. The main disadvantage is that traditional economies do not enjoy the things other economies take for granted: Western medicine, centralized utilities, technology, etc. But as anyone in America can attest, these things do not guarantee happiness, peace, social or, most ironically of all, economic stability.

2. **Command Economic System**

In terms of economic advancement, the command economic system is the next step up from a traditional economy. This by no means indicates that it is fairer or an exact improvement; there are many things fundamentally wrong with a command economy.

**Centralized Control:** The most notable feature of a command economy is that a large part of the economic system is controlled by a centralized power; often, a federal government. This kind of economy tends to develop when a country finds itself in possession of a very large amount of valuable resource(s). The government then steps in and regulates the resource(s). Often the government will own everything involved in the industrial process, from the equipment to the facilities.

**Supposed Advantages:** You can see how this kind of economy would, over time, create unrest among the general population. But there are actually several potential advantages, as long as the government uses intelligent regulations. First of all, a command economy is capable of creating a healthy supply of its own resources and it generally rewards its own people with affordable prices (but because it is ultimately regulated by the government, it is ultimately priced by the government). Still, there is often no shortage of jobs as the government functions similarly to a market economy in that it wants to grow and grow upon its populace.

**Hand In The Cookie Jar:** Interestingly – or maybe, predictably – the government in a command economy only desires to control its most valuable resources. Other things, like agriculture, are left to be regulated and run by the people. This is the nature of a command economy and many communist governments fall into this category.

You should also consider this [**micro and macro economics program.**](https://udemyblog.wpengine.com/economics-for-investors/?tc=blog.typesofeconomicsystems&amp;couponCode=half-off-for-blog) It&#39;s been approved by the CFA institute and focuses on the impact of economic variables on the financial market and industry.

3. **Market Economic System**

A market economy is very similar to a free market. The government does not control vital resources, valuable goods or any other major segment of the economy. In this way, organizations run by the people determine how the economy runs, how supply is generated, what demands are necessary, etc.

**Capitalism And Socialism:** No truly free market economy exists in the world. For example, while America is a capitalist nation, our government still regulates (or attempts to regulate) fair trade, government programs, moral business, monopolies, etc. etc. The advantage to capitalism is you can have an explosive economy that is very well controlled and relatively safe. This would be contrasted to socialism, in which the government (like a command economy) controls and owns the most profitable and vital industries but allows the rest of the market to operate freely; that is, price is allowed to fluctuate freely based on supply and demand.

**Market Economy And Politics:** Arguably the biggest advantage to a market economy (at least, outside of economic benefits) is the separation of the market and the government. This prevents the government from becoming too powerful, too controlling and too similar to the governments of the world that oppress their people while living lavishly on controlled resources. In the same way that separation of church and state has been to vital to America&#39;s social success, so has a separation of market and state been vital to our economic success. Yes, there is something wary about a system which to be successful must foster constant growth, but as a result progress and innovation have occurred at such incredible rates as to affect the way the world economy functions.

4. **Mixed Economic System**

A mixed economic system (also known as a Dual Economy) is just like it sounds (a combination of economic systems), but it primarily refers to a mixture of a market and command economy (for obvious reasons, a traditional economy does not typically mix well). As you can imagine, many variations exist, with some mixed economies being primarily free markets and others being strongly controlled by the government. Learn more about an essential part of our economy with this [**free post on understanding the stock market.**](https://blog.udemy.com/understanding-the-stock-market/)

**Benefits Of A Mixed Economy:** In the most common types of mixed economies, the market is more or less free of government ownership except for a few key areas. These areas are usually _not_ the resources that a command economy controls. Instead, as in America, they are the government programs such as education, transportation, USPS, etc. While all of these industries also exist in the private sector in America, this is not always the case for a mixed economy.

**Disadvantages Of A Mixed Economy:** While a mixed economy can lead to incredible results (America being the obvious example), it can also suffer from similar downfalls found in other economies. For example, the last hundred years in America has seen a rise in government power. Not just in imposing laws and regulations, but in actually gaining control, becoming more difficult to access while simultaneously becoming less flexible. This is a common tendency of mixed economies.

**Please Respect The Thin Line:** A current, pivotal debate between Democrats and Republicans is the amount of governmental control. Can a true balance exist? Where should there be more government regulation? Where should there be less? These questions have no real answer; it is subjective, and therefore only a relatively small portion of the population will, at any given time, agree with the state of a mixed economy. It must be a strong form of government indeed to avoid collapsing under this constant pressure.
