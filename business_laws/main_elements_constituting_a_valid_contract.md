# Main Elements constituting A Valid Contract

Contract is an official agreement. It could be written or even be in oral. Contracts can be written by using formal or informal terms, or entirely verbal or spoken. It is a promise made between two or more parties that which allow the courts to make judgement. A contract has six important elements so that it will be valid which is offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to create legal relation, certainty and capacity. If the main elements are not in contract, it would be an invalid contract.

1.1.1 Offer

The first element in a valid contract would be offer. An offer or a promise or an agreement needs to be in contract because if there is no offer than there will be no contract. In the Contracts Act, 1950, the first elements in a contract would be offer. It is one of the elements to make sure that the contract is legally valid or acceptable. In a contract, it is very important that a party would make an offer. There is a difference of offer between an advertisement and an option. To make an offer, there should be at least two parties or even more so that it would be legally capable of entering into a contract. If the offer is accepted than it would constitutes to a legally valid contract. When an offer is being made, the other party or person would know what is being offer and what the person or party who made the offer expect to have in return. It is the same when anybody goes on a holiday, stays at a hotel and so on. For example, a family has made an arrangement with a tour agency to have a holiday at Hong Kong for a few days. The tour agency would make a contract by making forms to the family which would have to be filling up. The family member who fills up the form would have to be clear with the rules and regulations given by the tour agency company. Once it is fills up, the contract has been made between the family and the tour agency.

1.1.2 Acceptance

After having an offer in the contract, there should be acceptance. For a contract to be made there should be acceptance from the other party or person. When the other party is clear with the offer, there would make an acceptance once they are clear with the rules and regulations being offer in the contract. There will be no contract if the parties are still negotiating or discussing and have not made accept the offer. The person or party can accept the offer being made in writing or orally which is made verbally or being spoken out. For example, a tourist writes to hotel K requesting information about the cost and availability of accommodation for the week commencing on the 15th April 2011. The staff at hotel K answers the inquiry states that the accommodation available for that week would cost RM 600 and if the tourist responds with the deposit of RM 100 within a week, then the room will be allocated to him. If the tourist accepts the offer, then the contract has been made for the tourist and hotel K.

1.1.3 Consideration

Consideration is also a very important element in the contract. Consideration in a contract would mean the other person would be giving back something in return. It would be consider as an exchange which would be made between the promisee and promissor. There should be consideration in a contract so that it would be legally valid. For example, a customer in a fast food restaurant like McDonalds orders a set lunch which costs RM7.95. By ordering the set lunch, the customer is agreeing to pay RM7.95 as consideration. However, consideration does not give any threats to on &#39; line holiday contracts. Holiday services which are being provided by the on &#39; line holiday providers and also the consideration by giving something back in return which would be the payment money or even the payment made by the holiday makers would eventually follow the requirements for consideration of a contract.

1.1.4 Intention to Create Legal Relations

It is essential to have this element in a contract. It is a necessity of the intention to create legal relations although the Contracts Act 1950 is silent on the intention to create legal relations as one of the requirements of a valid contract. This element would have an agreement which is not a contract in the strict sense unless it is the common intention of the parties that it should be legally enforceable. If there is no intention to create legal relations in a contract, the contract could be subject to a lawsuit. For example, when there is a contract or an agreement made between the parent and the children. If the parent passes away, the children would have whatever property or possession which is left by the parent.

1.1.5 Certainty

Another main element in a contract would be certainty. The terms and regulations being made in a contract should be stated clearly and understood by the parties of the contract. If the agreement is not certain, it would be no longer valid. For example, if the guest wants to stay in a hotel, , the guest needs to inform how many days he or she is staying at the hotel, the type of room, and also the date when he or she are going stay and the number of days he or she is staying.

1.1.6 Capacity

Capacity in a contract is the parties to the contract must have the legal capacity to do so. 18 years old is stated as the age of a major. Minors who are people below the age of eighteen have no capacity to enter into contracts. Therefore, insane people or people with unsound minds also cannot enter into any valid contracts. For example, a person who is at the age of sixteen years old could not stay at a hotel. The hotel staff would not allow having the person who is sixteen years old to stay at the hotel since that person is not eighteen years old or above. For the person to stay at the hotel, he or she must have a guardian who is above eighteen years old or a parent to accompany him or her to stay in the hotel.

**Definition**

An agreement is an expansive concept that includes any arrangement or understanding between two or more parties about their rights and responsibilities with respect to one another. Such informal arrangements often take on the form of &quot;[gentlemen&#39;s agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentlemen%27s_Agreement),&quot; where adherence to the terms of the agreement relies upon the honor of the parties involved rather than exterior means of enforcement.

A contract is a specific type of agreement that meets certain requirements designed to create [legally](https://www.diffen.com/difference/Category:Legal) binding obligations between parties that are enforceable by a [court of law](https://www.diffen.com/difference/Circuit_Court_vs_District_Court).

**Requirements**

In order to reach an agreement, parties need only come to a common understanding as to their relative rights and responsibilities, what is often termed a &quot;meeting of the minds.&quot; The requirements for the formation of a contract are more precise and comparatively stricter. A contract must contain the following essential elements:

- **Offer and Acceptance:** Every contract must include a specific offer, and the acceptance of that specific offer.
- **Mutual Consent:** The offer and acceptance must be freely consented to by the parties, without coercion. All parties must agree to the same terms, and all must intend for a binding agreement to be formed.
- **Consideration:** This is something of value that is exchanged between the parties. Consideration can take the form of money, goods, or services, but both parties must provide something of value for a contract to be formed. If only one side provides something, it is a gift, not a contract.
- **Competence:** Both parties must comprehend the situation and understand what the contract will entail. Thus, no party can be a minor, under the influence of [drugs](https://www.diffen.com/difference/Cocaine_vs_Crack)r alcohol, or mentally deficient in a way that would prevent them from understanding the terms of the contract. A non-competent party to a contract may disavow the contract, which would render it void.
- **Legal Purpose:** The purpose of the contract must fall within the confines of lawful conduct. In other words, a court would never enforce a contract regarding something illegal.

So long as a contract meets the requirements above, it is enforceable in a court of law, which means that a court can compel a non-compliant party to abide by the terms of the contract. Generally, a contract does not need to be [in writing](https://www.diffen.com/difference/Libel_vs_Slander), and in many cases, an oral agreement with all of the elements listed above will constitute a valid and enforceable contract.

Some situations, however, require that a contract be in writing to be enforceable. In the United States, these situations are laid out in each state&#39;s statute of frauds. While the precise list of situations vary from [state](https://www.diffen.com/difference/Commonwealth_vs_State) to state, most statutes of frauds require that contracts for the following be in writing:

- Transactions involving real estate
- [Marriage](https://www.diffen.com/difference/Marriage_vs_Wedding) contracts
- Transactions that require more than one year to complete

This video walks you through how a good business contract should be created:

**Examples**

An agreement may simply involve one party accepting another party&#39;s offer. Since this scenario does not involve consideration, it is not a contract. Other common examples of agreements which are not contracts include gentlemen&#39;s agreements and unlicensed betting pools. The key element to all non-contract agreements is that they are not legally enforceable.

Common examples of contracts are non-disclosure agreements, end-user license agreements **(both despite being called &quot;agreements&quot;)**, employment contracts, and accepted purchase orders. Regardless of how it is named, as long as an agreement contains the required elements of a contract enumerated above, a court may enforce it as such.

**Benefits**

The primary benefit of an agreement that does not meet the criteria of a contract is that it is inherently informal. Where the agreeing parties have a longstanding relationship and share a considerable degree of trust, the use of a non-contract agreement can save time and allow for more flexibility in the fulfillment of the agreed-upon obligations. Agreements lacking all the required elements of a contract may also be more viable in situations where the drafting of a contract would prove prohibitively burdensome on the parties involved.

The main advantage of contracts is that they spell out the specific terms that the contracting parties have agreed upon, and in the event of a breach – where one or more parties fail to fulfill their obligations – serve as a guide for a court of law to determine the proper remedy for the injured party or parties. Even where parties have a good relationship and trust one another, the use of a contract provides an extra layer of assurance that the obligations entered into under the contract will be fulfilled as the parties themselves intended. Contracts are generally advisable over less stringent agreements in any official business or commercial matter due to the added protection they provide.

### Types of Agents

An &quot;agent&quot; is a person employed to do any act for another, or to represent another in dealing with third persons. The person for whom such act is done, or who is so represented, is called the &quot;principal&quot;.

As between the principal and third persons, any person may become an agent, but no person who is not of the age of majority and sound mind can become an agent, so as to be responsible to the principal according to the provisions in that behalf herein contained. No consideration is necessary to create an agency.

The authority of an agent may be express or implied. An authority is said to be express when it is given by words spoken or written. An authority is said to be implied when it is to be inferred from the circumstances of the case; and things spoken or written, or the ordinary course of dealing, may be accounted circumstances of the case.

**Agents can be classified in various ways:**

Special Agents: Agent appointed for a particular task only. The agency in such cases lasts for a specific period of for a particular type of job or work. For example… a property dealer appointed as an agent for a sale of a property is authorize his rights in regards to that property only and that too till its sale or revocation of agency by the principal.

General Agents: As the name suggests, the agent has a general authority in such a case. To elaborate, we could say a general agent is one who has authority to do all the acts (usually related to business or Trade) in the interest of his principal. A general agent has a implied authority to bind his principal by doing various acts necessary for carrying on the business of his principal.

Universal Agents: Universal agent is practically a general agent with very extensive rights. We can say that an universal agent is a substitute of principal for all those transactions where in principal cannot participate. We rarely find universal agents in business world today, however in personal life, a wife, son or a very close friend or relative could become a universal agent. For example: when a person leaves his country for a long time, he may appoint his son as his universal agent to act on his behalf in his absence.

Co-Agents: This happens when a principal appoints two or more person as agents jointly. Their authority is joint when nothing is mentioned. It implies that all co-agents concur in the exercise of their authority unless their authority is fixed or unless circumstances reveal any intention to the contrary. But when their authority is several, any other of the co-agents can act without the concurrence of the other.

Sub-Agents: In the language of law, a sub-agent would be &quot;a person employed and acting under the control of the original agent in the business of the agency &quot;.  In simple words, sub-agent is an agent of the original agent. As far as third party is concerned, principal can be held liable for the acts of sub-agent in certain cases like fraud etc. however in general, agent is responsible to the principal for the acts of sub-agent.

Substituted Agents: Substituted agent is almost same as a co-agent or sub-agent. Sections 194 and 195 deals with substituted agents. It states &quot;when an agent holding on express or implied authority to name another person to act for and on behalf of his principal in his business, such agent is know as substituted agent. There are certain differences between the two, which could be better understood by the way of following illustration: Mr. RR authorizes Mr. YY, who is a businessman in Pune, to recover the money due to RR from ABC Company. YY, in turn, instructs NN, a solicitor, to take necessary legal actions and recover the dues. Here, NN is not a sub-agent but a solicitor for R.

To elaborate more on points of distinction between sub-agents and co-agents we can have following arguments:

- A substituted agent acts under the direct control his principal where as sub-agent works under the original agent.

- An agent does not delegate any part of his tasks or duties to a substituted agent, whereas as he does that to a sub-agent.

- In case of a substituted agent, there is always a privacy of contract between the principal and the substituted agent, both can sue each other, however a sub-agent is not directly answerable to the principal, they can&#39;t sue each other, however both can sue the agent.

**Other classification of agents is as follows:**

Factor: As per the section 2 of sale of goods act, there is an agent known as Mercantile Agent. As the name suggest he is the one who works for the business (merchandize) of the principal. A Factor is one type of a mercantile agent who sells goods on behalf of his principal. He has wide authority and discretionary powers to sell goods upon such terms and conditions as he thinks proper. He in broader terms relieves his principal from the burden of his work. If a factor does any act which is beyond his authority, but which is within the scope of his apparent authority, then his principal is bound by such act.

Broker: A broker is a special type of mercantile agent who acts as a middleman between the buyer and the seller. We can say that he is employed to bring about contractual relationship between the principal and the third party. He usually gets commission for the work performed. His function ends when he brings the two parties together. He is never in possession of the subject, therefore cannot exercise the right of lien.

Auctioneer: Auction is usually a public sale of goods made in the highest of several bidders. An auctioneer is a mercantile agent who is appointed to sell goods on behalf of principal, compensated in terms of commission.

Commission Agents: A commission agent is generally, appointed for selling or buying goods on behalf of his principal. Such types of agents belongs to a somewhat indefinite class of agents.

Del Credere Agents: A Del Credere agent is a mercantile agent who is employed to sell goods on behalf of his principal. He undertakes to guarantee the payment of dues in consideration for an extra commission. We can say that besides being a mercantile agent a del credere agent finds himself into the shoes of a guarantor as well.

Forwarding Agents: Forwarding agents render services of collecting goods from their principals and forwarding the same to shipping companies. As foreign trade procedures are more complex that the procedures of home trade, the service of forwarding agents hence helps the producers and exporters to a great extent.

Clearing Agents: As forwarding agents help the exporters of goods, clearing agents help the importers of goods. They complete various complicated customs and exchange formalities on behalf of the importers who appoint them.
