# Definition

It is very important to understand at the outset that the, modern concept of marketing revolves around the customer. Satisfaction of customer is the main aim of marketing. For achieving this goal, marketing research is undertaken.

In fact, marketing management is nothing but marketing research. With the expansion of business, marketing management becomes complex. It has to rely heavily on marketing research for solving problems in the field of marketing.

Various definitions of marketing research are given below.

> “The systematic gathering, recording and analysis of data about problems relating to the marketing of goods and services” 
> 
> —The American Marketing Association.

> “The systematic objective and exhaustive research for and study of the facts relevant to any problem in the field of marketing.”
> 
> —Richard Crisp

> “Marketing research is the careful and objective study of product design, markets, and such transfer activities as physical distribution and warehousing, advertising and sales management.”
> 
>  —Clark and Clark

> “Marketing research is the inclusive term which embraces all research activities carried on for the management of marketing work, the gathering, recording and analysing of all facts about problems relating to the transfer and sale of goods and services from producer to consumer.”
> 
> —Harry Hapner

From the above definitions, it is clear that marketing research is concerned with tackling the problems emerging from the beginning to the final stage of marketing process.

The origin and development of marketing research was started in England. In 1911, Prof. Arthur Bowie used the method of random sampling and published a paper entitled “Working Class Households.” Afterwards, it was developed by a German Prof. Whilhelm Vershofen, who is known as the father of market research.

Marketing research techniques and methods are being increasingly adopted by all the countries of the world whether developed, developing or underdeveloped. In America, marketing research is conducted by many companies on a very high scale.

# Marketing Research V/S Market Research

Marketing research is a broader term including market research. Marketing research is concerned with all the major functions of marketing. Market research is primarily concerned with knowing the capacity of the market to absorb a particular product. Marketing research is not only concerned with the jurisdiction of the market but also covers nature of the market, product analysis, sales analysis, time, place and media of advertising, personal selling and marketing intermediaries and their relationships etc.

# Marketing Research

Marketing research serves the purpose of ‘intelligence wing of the marketing management. Its scope is very broad as compared to market- research. It is concerned with collection of market information systematically and impartially, analysis and evaluation of relevant data and use such data for the benefit of the organisation.

It is a careful and objective study of various areas of marketing activities. What, when, where and how to sell the end product and the services are four questions to which the marketing research wing provides an answer.

Thus, market research and marketing research are different from each other. Market research is a narrow concept whereas marketing research is a broad one and its scope is much wider.

It includes nature of the market, product analysis, sales analysis, time, place and media of advertising, personal selling, pricing, sales organisation, packaging, brand names, etc.

# Objectives of Marketing Research

Marketing research is undertaken for attaining the following objectives.

1. To Provide Basis For Proper Planning

    Marketing and sales forecast research provides sound basis for the formulation of all marketing plans, policies, programmes and procedures.

2. To Reduce Marketing Costs
    
    Marketing research provides ways and means to reduce marketing costs like selling, advertisement and distribution etc.

3. To Find Out New Markets for The Product

    Marketing research aims at exploring new markets for the product and maintaining the existing ones.

4. To Determine Proper Price Policy

    Marketing research is considered helpful in the formulation of proper price policy with regard to the products.

5. To Study in Detail Likes and Dislikes of the Consumers

    Marketing research tries to find out what the consumers, (the men and women who constitute the market) think and want. It keeps us in touch with the consumers, minds and to study their likes and dislikes.

6. To Know The Market Competition

    Marketing research also aims at knowing the quantum of competition prevalent in the market about the product in question. The company may need reliable information about competitor’s moves and strategies which are of immense significance for further planning.

7. To Study The External Forces and Their Impact

    Marketing research provides valuable information by studying the impact of external forces on the organisation. External forces may include conditions developing in foreign markets, govt, policies and regulations, consumer incomes and spending habits, new products entering in the market and their impact on the company’s products.

Prof. Gilies has rightly pointed out that, “The basic objective of marketing research is to supply management with information which will lead to a fuller understanding of the distribution habits and attitudes of present and potential buyers and users, and their reactions to products, packing, selling and advertising methods”.

# Research Process

Some of the major steps involved in marketing research process are as follows.

1. Identification and Defining the Problem

2. Statement of Research Objectives 

3. Planning the Research Design or Designing the Research Study 

4. Planning the Sample 

5. Data Collection

6. Data Processing and Analysis

7. Formulating Conclusion, Preparing and Presenting the Report.

Marketing research exercise may take many forms but systematic enquiry is a feature common to all such forms. Being a systematic enquiry, it requires a careful planning of the orderly investigation process.

Though it is not necessary that all research processes would invariably follow a given sequence, yet marketing research often follows a generalised pattern which can be broken down and studied as sequential stages.

## Identification and Defining the Problem

The market research process begins with the identification “of a problem faced by the company. The clear-cut statement of problem may not be possible at the very outset of research process because often only the symptoms of the problems are apparent at that stage. Then, after some explanatory research, clear definition of the problem is of crucial importance in marketing research because such research is a costly process involving time, energy and money.

Clear definition of the problem helps the researcher in all subsequent research efforts including setting of proper research objectives, the determination of the techniques to be used, and the extent of information to be collected.

It may be noted that the methods of explanatory research popularly in use are—survey of secondary data, experience survey, or pilot studies, i.e., studies of a small initial sample. All this is also known as ‘preliminary investigation’.

## Statement of Research Objectives

After identifying and defining the problem with or without explanatory research, the researcher must take a formal statement of research objectives. Such objectives may be stated in qualitative or quantitative terms and expressed as research questions, statement or hypothesis. For example, the research objective, “To find out the extent to which sales promotion schemes affected the sales volume” is a research objective expressed as a statement.

On the other hand, a hypothesis is a statement that can be refuted or supported by empirical finding. The same research objective could be stated as, “To test the proposition that sales are positively affected by the sales promotion schemes undertaken this winter.”

Example of another hypothesis may be: “The new packaging pattern has resulted in increase in sales and profits.” Once the objectives or the hypotheses are developed, the researcher is ready to choose the research design.

## Planning the Research Design or Designing the Research Study

After defining the research problem and deciding the objectives, the research design must be developed. A research design is a master plan specifying the procedure for collecting and analysing the needed information. It represents a framework for the research plan of action.

The objectives of the study are included in the research design to ensure that data collected are relevant to the objectives. At this stage, the researcher should also determine the type of sources of information needed, the data collection method (e.g., survey or interview), the sampling, methodology, and the timing and possible costs of research.

## Planning the Sample

Sampling involves procedures that use a small number of items or parts of the ‘population’ (total items) to make conclusion regarding the ‘population’. Important questions in this regard are— who is to be sampled as a rightly representative lot? Which is the target ‘population’? What should be the sample size—how large or how small? How to select the various units to make up the sample?

## Data Collection

The collection of data relates to the gathering of facts to be used in solving the problem. Hence, methods of market research are essentially methods of data collection. Data can be secondary, i.e., collected from concerned reports, magazines and other periodicals, especially written articles, government publications, company publications, books, etc.

Data can be primary, i.e., collected from the original base through empirical research by means of various tools.

There can be broadly two types of sources

1. Internal sources — existing within the firm itself, such as accounting data, salesmen’s reports, etc.

2. External sources — outside the firm.

## Data Processing and Analysis

Once data have been collected, these have to be converted into a format that will suggest answers to the initially identified and defined problem. Data processing begins with the editing of data and its coding. Editing involves inspecting the data-collection forms for omission, legibility, and consistency in classification. Before tabulation, responses need to be classified into meaningful categories.

The rules for categorizing, recording and transferring the data to ‘data storage media’ are called codes. This coding process facilitates the manual or computer tabulation. If computer analysis is being used, the data can be key punched and verified.

Analysis of data represents the application of logic to the understanding of data collected about the subject. In its simplest form analysis may involve determination of consistent patterns and summarising of appropriate details.

The appropriate analytical techniques chosen would depend upon informational requirements of the problem, characteristics of the research designs and the nature of the data gathered. The statistical analysis may range from simple immediate analysis to very complex multivariate analysis.

## Formulating Conclusion, Preparing and Presenting the Report

The final stage in the marketing research process is that of interpreting the information and drawing conclusion for use in managerial decision. The research report should clearly and effectively communicate the research findings and need not include complicated statement about the technical aspect of the study and research methods.

Often the management is not interested in details of research design and statistical analysis, but instead, in the concrete findings of the research. If need be, the researcher may bring out his appropriate recommendations or suggestions in the matter. Researchers must make the presentation technically accurate, understandable and useful.
